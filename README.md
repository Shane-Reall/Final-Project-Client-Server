# Final-Project-Client-Server
My final project for Client Server Systems. It's a multiplayer card game called Triple Triad, where it's the player's goal to have as many tiles in their color as possible.

All card Art is made by Me, inspired and based on online images and art. This code contains a Credits Section in the Client Code.
